        "### **Q1: Key Features of the Wine Quality Dataset and Their Importance**  \n",
        "The **Wine Quality Dataset** includes physicochemical properties such as **fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol**. Among these, **alcohol, volatile acidity, sulphates, and citric acid** are strong predictors of wine quality. Alcohol content is positively correlated with quality, while high volatile acidity negatively affects taste.  \n",

        "### **Q2: Handling Missing Data in Wine Quality Dataset**  \n",
        "Common imputation techniques include **mean, median, and KNN imputation**. **Mean/median imputation** is simple but may distort feature distributions. **KNN imputation** uses similar data points for replacement, preserving relationships better but is computationally expensive. If missing values are significant, **dropping the feature** might be necessary.  \n",

        "### **Q3: Factors Affecting Students' Exam Performance and Statistical Analysis**  \n",
        "Key factors include **study time, attendance, parental education, socio-economic status, and mental health**. Statistical methods like **correlation analysis, regression models, and ANOVA** help analyze their impact. **Regression models** predict performance, while **ANOVA** compares different groups (e.g., effects of parental education).  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q4: Feature Engineering for Student Performance Dataset**  \n",
        "Feature selection includes **one-hot encoding categorical variables** (e.g., parental education), normalizing numerical variables (e.g., study time), and creating interaction terms (e.g., study time × parental involvement). Transformations such as **log scaling for skewed data** and **binning numerical scores** into categories improve model interpretability.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Q5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Wine Quality Dataset**  \n",
        "By plotting histograms and skewness, we identify **non-normal features** like **density, residual sugar, and total sulfur dioxide**. Transformations such as **log, square root, or Box-Cox transformation** can help normalize these distributions and improve model performance.  \n",

        "### **Q6: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Wine Quality Dataset**  \n",
        "PCA is applied to reduce dimensionality while retaining variance. **Explained variance analysis** using a scree plot determines the minimum number of principal components required to explain **90% of the variance**. Typically, **5–7 principal components** are needed, depending on feature correlations."
