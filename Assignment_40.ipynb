        "Data encoding is the process of converting categorical data into a numerical format for use in machine learning models. It is essential because most ML algorithms work with numerical data. Encoding helps retain meaningful relationships between categories and improves model accuracy. Common techniques include one-hot encoding, label encoding, and ordinal encoding.  \n",

        "Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, assigns a unique integer to each category without implying any order. For example, in a car rental dataset with categories like [\"Sedan,\" \"SUV,\" \"Hatchback\"], nominal encoding would assign values like {\"Sedan\": 0, \"SUV\": 1, \"Hatchback\": 2}. This method is useful when there is no ordinal relationship between categories.  \n",

For example, in an e-commerce dataset with 500 different product categories, nominal encoding is more efficient than one-hot encoding because it avoids excessive feature expansion.  \n",
